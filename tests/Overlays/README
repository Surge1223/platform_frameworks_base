Manual tests for runtime resource overlays

This directory contains

    - target: app which will have its resources overlaid
    - red, green, blue: overlay packages for target app
    - system: overlay package for the Android framework

Install the apks and grant the target app the required permission:

    $ adb root
    $ adb remount
    $ adb exec-out stop
    $ adb sync vendor
    $ adb exec-out start
    $ adb install $OUT/data/app/OverlaysTarget/OverlaysTarget.apk
    $ adb exec-out pm grant com.android.test.overlay.target \
                            android.permission.CHANGE_OVERLAY_PACKAGES

The Target app contains buttons to enable or disable the overlays, and to
change their priority. Alternatively, commands can be passed via adb:

    $ adb root
    $ adb exec-out cmd overlay list
    $ adb exec-out cmd overlay enable com.android.test.overlay.red

The app displays three color blobs. Without any enabled overlays, they blobs
will all be gray. When enabled, the red overlay makes all three fields red, the
green makes two of them green and the blue overlay makes one of them blue. By
changing the priority of the overlays the fields can be red, green, blue, or
all red, or something in between.

The system overlay modifies the framework's black and white colors. These show
up in many UI elements, such as the power dialog (long press the power key).
